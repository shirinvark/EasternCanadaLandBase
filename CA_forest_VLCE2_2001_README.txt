High-resolution annual forest land cover maps for Canada’s forested 
ecosystems (1984-2022)

Description:
-------------------
The annual time series of forest land cover maps are national in scope 
(entire 650 million hectare forested ecosystem) and represent a 
wall-to-wall land cover characterization yearly from 1984 to 2022. 
These time-series land cover maps were produced from annual 
time-series of Landsat image composites, forest change information, 
and ancillary topographic and hydrologic data following the framework 
described in Hermosilla et al. (2022), which builds upon the approach 
introduced in Hermosilla et al. (2018). The methodological innovations 
included (i) a refined training pool derived from existing land cover 
products using airborne and spaceborne measures of forest structure; 
(ii) selection of training samples proportionally to the land cover 
distribution using a distance=weighted approach; and (iii) generation 
of regional classification models using a 150x150 km tiling system. 
Maps are post-processed using disturbance information to ensure 
logical class transitions over time using a Hidden Markov Model. 
Hidden Markov Models assess individual year class likelihoods to 
reduce variability and possible noise in year-on-year class 
assignments (for instances when class likelihoods are similar).

detection methods applied, as well as information on independent 
accuracy assessment of the data, see Hermosilla et al. (2022)

The data represents annual forest land cover of Canada's forested 
ecosystems for 1984-2022. An image compositing window of August 1 ± 
30 days was used to generate the best-available-pixel (BAP) image 
composites used as the source data for land cover classification. The 
science and methods developed to generate the information outcomes 
shown here, that track and characterize the history of Canada’s 
forests, were led by Canadian Forest Service of Natural Resources 
Canada, partnered with the University of British Columbia, with 
support from the Canadian Space Agency, augmented by processing 
capacity from WestGrid of Compute Canada.
